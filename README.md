# churn-prediction

It is very critical for business to have an idea about why and when customers are likely to churn. Having a robust and accurate churn prediction model helps businesses to take actions to prevent customers from leaving the company.

In this project, I will use "Telco Customer Churn" data set which is available on Kaggle.

There are 20 features (independent variables) and 1 target (dependent) variable for 7043 customers. Target variable indicates if a customer has has left the company (i.e. churn=yes) within the last month. Since the target variable has two states (yes/no or 1/0), this is a binary classification problem.
